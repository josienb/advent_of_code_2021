# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021) in Ruby.
Emphasis on solutions, not on beautiful code!

## Run

Clone the repo, cd into the repo folder, then:  

```bash
$ ruby day01/part1.rb
$ ruby day01/part2.rb
$ ...
```

Or execute `main` to run all scripts consecutively:

```bash
$ ruby main.rb
```
